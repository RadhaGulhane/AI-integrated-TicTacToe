# TicTacToe

## Abstract
Tic Tac Toe is a famous two player game usually played by the young children as part of fun activity. It also helps to build cognitive power of children. This project provides option to play this game as single or double player including easy and hard level option in case of single player feature.

## How to play
It is a famous two player game which played on a three-by-three grid with X or O. Each player will get chance to mark the cell spcaes three-by-three grid. The player who able to place his marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row will succeed.

## Algorithm
It is very simple to build Tic Tac Toe for two player feature as it requires to just track the marked cells and success scenarios. While, the one player approach requires algorithm which will decide the next move by computer against the user. I have made use of randomized moves for easy level. Increasing the difficulty level, I used the heuristic approach which will find out the best move against the user.
